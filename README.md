# ðŸ“š Book Management REST API

This is a simple RESTful API built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** to manage a list of books. It supports basic CRUD operations â€” Create, Read, Update, and Delete â€” using in-memory storage (no database).

## ðŸš€ Features

- View all books (GET `/books`)
- Add a new book (POST `/books`)
- Update an existing book by ID (PUT `/books/:id`)
- Delete a book by ID (DELETE `/books/:id`)

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- JSON (in-memory storage)
- Postman (for testing)
